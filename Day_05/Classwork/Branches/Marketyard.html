      A library is an integral part of any educational institution. SunBeam
      Students have long enjoyed the educational and cultural benefits of our
      library service. Library resources and usage has grown steadily, and today
      the library at SunBeam Institute of Information Technology is fully
      equipped with over 100 titles and periodicals. The library currently
      offers a collection of hundreds of items, including books, magazines, CDs,
      and more which are required to fulfill needs of a candidate undergoing a
      CDAC ACTS IT course. It houses books suggested from C-DAC and many other
      popular titles which help the students to gain additional knowledge in
      areas of their interest. The library facility at SunBeam offers increased
      convenience in skill building, which in turn facilitates increased
      enthusiastic participation of our students in interactive academic
      sessions.
